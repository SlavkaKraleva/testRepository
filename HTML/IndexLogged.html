                        <h2>Sofia &ndash; the social Robot?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has
                        become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest
                        of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top
                        fashion magazines. Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential
                        across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance,
                        auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has
                        appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how
                        robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her
                        reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first
                        United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an
                        official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights
                        and equality. Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness,
                        expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating
                        front-page technology story.

                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day
                        renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act
                        amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius
                        machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively
                        human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines:
                        Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’
                        genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves.
                        Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting
                        platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in
                        business, medical/healthcare, and education

                        <h2> Seven ways the new ‘It’ movie differs from Stephen King’s novel </h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        It has been called the most faithful Stephen King adaptation yet, but did you spot these seven differences between book and film?

                        Until they work out a way to film your imagination, the film will never be as good as the book. But by splitting Stephen King’s mammoth 1986 epic It into two films, Andy Muschietti has achieved one of the most faithful King adaptations to date, at least for the bits of the book following The Losers Club as children. We’ll have to wait for the second part to judge exactly how accurately It has leapt from the page, but as the first movie smashes box office records we can certainly nit-pick over the changes made to the original story. If the manifestation of your worst childhood fear is a blog full of major plot spoilers, welcome to your nightmare.



                        The dodgy sewer sex


                        Most newsworthy amongst the changes to the book is the – frankly welcome – removal of the random underage sewer gang-bang. By far the weirdest part of a very weird novel, the children find themselves lost in the sewers after facing It for the first time and, for no obvious reason, can only find the unity and focus to find their way out if they all have sex with Beverly. Creepy in all the wrong ways, the scene was incongruous and controversial and thankfully Muschietti felt that the blood oath the children swear to return to defeat the monster was all the bodily fluids they needed to swap to get the point across. Let’s face it, if intense shagging was the best way to find your way out of a maze, Hampton Court would be Britain’s biggest dogging site.
